# Cam-Mesh

## Overview
CamMesh is a theoretical offensive Python module designed to create a global mesh of compromised cameras and IoT devices for real-time surveillance. Inspired by the "God's Eye" system from *Fast and Furious*, it aims to achieve core visual omniscience or build a surveillance empire through a decentralized botnet. This project is intended for educational purposes or ethical security research under strictly controlled, authorized conditions.

**Warning**: Unauthorized use of this tool for malicious purposes is illegal under laws like the U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). Always obtain explicit permission before testing on any system.

## Features
- **P2P Botnet Architecture**: Leverages peer-to-peer networking for a resilient, decentralized camera network.  
- **Real-Time Stitching**: Combines feeds into a cohesive view of tracked targets.  
- **AI-Driven Facial/Behavior Tracking**: Uses advanced computer vision to identify and predict target actions.  

## Use Cases
- **God’s Eye Context**: Provides the backbone for omnipotent visual surveillance.  
- **General Context**: Establishes a surveillance empire for research into advanced monitoring techniques.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+  
- Access to IoT devices or cameras (hypothetical; not provided)  

## Dependencies
| Library         | Purpose                     | Installation              |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| `opencv-python` | Computer vision and recognition | `pip install opencv-python` |
| `pylibftdi`     | IoT device interfacing      | `pip install pylibftdi`   |

Additional requirement:  
- **YOLOv8**: A speculative 2025 version of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for object detection (not a standard package; assumes a custom or third-party implementation).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Code-Mornarch/Cam-Mesh.git
   cd cammesh
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Install YOLOv8 (assumed custom):
   - Download a pre-trained YOLOv8 model and place it in the project directory (e.g., `yolov8.pt`).
   - Ensure the `yolov8` module is available (hypothetical; not in PyPI).

## Usage
CamMesh is a module, not a standalone script. Below is a speculative example of how it might be used (non-functional, as I can’t execute code):

```python
import cv2
import pylibftdi
from yolov8 import YOLO

# Initialize IoT device interface
device = pylibftdi.Device()

# Load YOLOv8 model
yolo_model = YOLO("yolov8.pt")

def capture_feed(device_id):
    # Simulate camera feed from IoT device
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(device_id)
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if ret:
        return frame
    cap.release()
    return None

def stitch_feeds(feeds):
    # Placeholder for real-time stitching
    return cv2.hconcat(feeds)  # Simplified horizontal concatenation

def cam_mesh(device_list):
    feeds = []
    for dev_id in device_list:
        frame = capture_feed(dev_id)
        if frame is not None:
            # AI-driven tracking
            results = yolo_model.predict(frame)
            print(f"Detected: {results.faces} faces, Behavior: {results.behavior}")
            feeds.append(frame)
    if feeds:
        stitched = stitch_feeds(feeds)
        cv2.imshow("CamMesh Feed", stitched)
        cv2.waitKey(1)

# Example usage
devices = [0, 1]  # Hypothetical camera indices
cam_mesh(devices)
```

- **Steps**:  
  1. Import the module into your project.  
  2. Define a list of device IDs or indices for cameras/IoT devices.  
  3. Run to simulate feed capture and tracking.

## Technical Details
- **IoT Hacking**: `pylibftdi` interfaces with IoT hardware for low-level control (e.g., USB-connected cameras).  
- **Vision Processing**: `opencv-python` handles feed capture and stitching, paired with YOLOv8 for facial/behavior recognition.  
- **P2P**: Implied but not implemented here; real botnet logic would require additional networking libs (e.g., `libtorrent`).

## Limitations
- Requires a custom YOLOv8 implementation (not standard in 2024; speculative for 2025).  
- P2P botnet architecture is theoretical—real-world use needs extensive network coding.  
- Feed stitching is simplified; full real-time meshing demands GPU acceleration and latency optimization.
